> Empowering Indian farmers with simplified access to government subsidies through intelligent conversation, organized documentation, and comparative analysis.

## üåæ About The Project

**KrushiMitra** is a digital assistant that helps farmers navigate the complex landscape of agricultural subsidies. By providing personalized guidance, document checklists, and scheme comparisons in an accessible format, KrushiMitra aims to increase subsidy utilization among India's farming communities.

### üéØ The Problem We Solve

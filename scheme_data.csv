It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the remaining four years also. In case the cropping pattern adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be reworked.Term loans for investmentstowards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for the term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank’s judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.The long-term loan limitis based on the proposed investments during the five-year period and the bank’s perception of the repaying capacity of the farmerMaximum Permissible Limit: The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and treated as the Kisan Credit Card Limit.Fixation of Sub-limits for other than Marginal Farmers:Short-termloans and term loans are governed by different interest rates.

In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point in time, the total liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year.Wherever the card limit/liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may take suitable collateral as per their policy.","EligibilityEligibilityFarmers - individual/joint borrowers who are owner cultivators;Tenant farmers, oral lessees & share croppers;Self Help Groups (SHGs) or Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) of farmers including tenant farmers, share croppers etc","Application ProcessOnlineOfflineVisit the website of the bank you wish to apply for the kisan credit card scheme.From the list of options, choose the Kisan Credit Card.On clicking the option of ‘Apply’, the website will redirect you to the application page.Fill the form with the required details and click on ‘Submit’.On doing so, an application reference number will be sent.

https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/pmgsy,PMGSY Scheme,"DetailsWith the objective of providing rural connectivity, the Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (referred to as PMGSY-I hereinafter) on 25th December 2000 to provide all-weather access to eligible unconnected habitations with a population of up to 500(Census 2001) in plain area and 250 and above in Special category States(States of North East, Jammu, and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand), Desert Area as identified by Desert Development Program and 88 selected Backward Districts as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs/Planning Commission as a strategy for poverty alleviation.﻿As of 8th December 2021, a total of 6,80,040 km of road length has been constructed under various interventions of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). The primary objective of PMGSY concerns building robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations and other core areas. Panchayati Rajs and elected local representatives decide which habitations to be selected. This scheme was centrally funded only up to 2015-16. Since then, the funds have been divided between the Centre and the State. For North Eastern and Himalayan States (Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh) 90% of a project is the Union Government funds, and 10% of this cost, is the State Government funds. For the Other States, the Union Government funds around 60% of a project while the remaining 40% is by State Government funds.﻿Some prominent features of PMGSY are -Proper decentralized planning for the building of roads.Build roads according to the Indian Road Congress and Rural Roads Manual.3-tier quality management system.An unbroken flow of funds.﻿﻿﻿﻿",BenefitsThe benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are -1.  All-weather connection to the hamlets that are least or not connected.2.  Overall Development of the country allows for easy movement of goods and vehicles.3.  There are better employment opportunities for those from villages thanks to road connections.,"Eligibility1.  A region must be a habitation. It cannot be a hamlet or revenue village to be eligible for the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY).﻿2.  The Central Government describes habitation as a population cluster residing within an area that remains constant over time. Some of the local words used to describe a habitation are:Majras, Desam, Hamlets, Tolas, Dhanis﻿3.  The hamlet must have a higher population as per the 2001 Census to be eligible for road connection. The eligible habitations have a population of above 500 persons in plain areas and around 250 persons and above in hilly areas.","Application ProcessOfflineThe list of road works to be taken up under the Programme will be finalized each year by the District Panchayat in accordance with the allocation of funds communicated to the district. The District Panchayat has to ensure along with the consultative process, that the lists of proposed road works are part of the Core Network and that new connectivity is given priority.",,"Frequently Asked QuestionsDoes The Programme Provide Connectivity To Only Revenue Villages? Are Hamlets Eligible To Be Connected?The spirit and objective of PMGSY-I was to provide good all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The unit of this programme is a habitation and not a revenue village or a Panchayat. A habitation is a cluster of population, living in an area, the location of which does not change over time. Desam, Dhanis, Tolas, Majras, Hamlets, etc. are commonly used to describe habitations.

The population, as recorded in the Census 2001, shall be the basis for determining the population size of the habitation. The population of all Habitations within a radius of 500 metre (1.5 km of path distance in case of Hills) may be clubbed together to determine the population size. In the blocks bordering international boundary in the hill States (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs), however, all habitations within a path distance of 10 km may be treated as a cluster for this purpose. This cluster approach would enable the provision of connectivity to a number of Habitations, particularly in Hill/ mountainous areas.

A special dispensation has been allowed to Arunachal Pradesh under PMGSY by extending the Cluster approach to all International border districts in the State by clubbing population with the path distance of 10 km and treating as a Cluster.How Are Habitations Selected For Coverage? Who Decides Which Habitations Will Be Covered In A Year?Unconnected habitations are listed as per the priority (generally, habitations with a higher population, as per 2001 Census, would be connected first) and depending upon the funds likely to be made available for the State, the list of road works to be taken up under PMGSY-I will be finalized each year by the District Panchayat through a consultative process involving Panchayati Raj Institutions and elected representatives.Can An Individual Apply For Road Connectivity?The objective of PMGSY-I was to provide road connectivity to unconnected habitations as mentioned in response to Question 1 above. Any proposal for road connectivity may be perceived as per the programme guidelines.How Is Alignment Selected? Are Local Villagers Associated With This Process?A simple, non-formal transect walk shall be organised by the Assistant Engineer at the time of preparation of DPRs to finalise the alignment. The Panchayat Pradhan, local patwari, the JE, Local Revenue and Forest officials, Women PRI members and representatives of Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) also participate in the transect walk to determine the most suitable alignment, sort out the issues of land availability and to moderate any adverse social and environmental impact, eliciting necessary community participation in the programme. After transect walk, the minutes should be placed and approved by the Grama Sabha.Local people including those likely to be affected by proposed alignment are also allowed to put forth their view in this process.What Does All-Weather Connectivity Mean? Does It Mean Only Black- Topped Or Cement Concrete Roads?An all-weather road is one that is negotiable in all seasons of the year. This implies that the road-bed is drained effectively but this does not necessarily imply that it should be paved surface with blacktopping or cement concrete. A gravel road can also be an all-weather road.How Is The Problem Of Drainage Tackled In The Portion Of Roads Passing Through Built-Up Residential Areas?Road portions passing through built-up residential areas are prone to damages caused by wastewater from households. Programme guidelines provide for the construction of cement concrete pavement or cement/stone block pavements along with covered or uncovered Pucca side drains as per site conditions.Is The Adequate Provision For Culverts Or Cross-Drainage Works Made?The objective of the PMGSY is to provide an All-weather Road with necessary culverts and other cross drainage structures, which is operable throughout the year to the eligible unconnected habitations as per PMGSY guidelines in the rural areas. Rural roads constructed under PMGSY must have proper embankment and drainage. Adequate number and type of Cross Drainage (CD) works, including causeways, where appropriate, must be provided based on site requirements ascertained through necessary investigation. Minor bridges can be provided wherever necessary.

A necessary advisory has been already issued to the State Governments to include the culverts/CDs bridges along with the road proposals.

The proposal of long-span Bridges should be prepared as a separate DPR. However, such proposals of Bridges should be submitted with road proposals in the same batch.What About Bridges On Rivers/Streams?Bridges on rivers/streams crossing the alignment of the road are taken up under the program along with the road proposal. The Ministry issued PMGSY-III guidelines increasing the span of Long-Span Bridges (LSBs) for funding under PMGSY as follows:

Up to 200 m in respect of Special Category States and LWE districts identified by the MHA.
Upto 150 m in respect of other States.Whether Compensation For Land Acquisition Is Paid In The Program?The rural road is a State subject and it is the responsibility of State Government/ District Panchayat to ensure the availability of land for construction of road works under the programme. In view of the common benefit, generally, the land for construction of roads under PMGSY is made available by the villagers/Panchayat free of cost through voluntary donation. However, in rare cases, if the land is acquired for construction of roads under PMGSY, the State Government is required to pay compensation.How Are Executants Selected For The Construction Of Roads?Executants for construction of roads are selected through open competitive bidding for which well-established procedure for tendering is followed by the State Government. As per provisions, the bidders who have the prescribed qualifications and have the capacity to execute the works are required to take part in the bidding process. To enhance the transparency in tendering and speed up the tendering process, e- procurement of bids has been made mandatory.If Defects Are Noticed After Completion Of The Road, How Are They Rectified?As per provisions of the contract, the contractor is liable for any defect that may occur until 5 years after completion of the road work. To enforce liability of defects, the security amount is deducted from the bills of the contractors. The contractor has to rectify the defect in the above period and if the rectification has not been carried out, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is required to rectify the defect and recover the cost from the security deposit of the contractor.How Is The Quality Of Work Checked And Monitored?Every contractor is required to establish a field laboratory in every package of road works in which he/she required to test the quality of material and workmanship under the supervision of executing agency. In addition to checking of quality by departmental officers of executing agency, the State Government is required to deploy independent monitors for monitoring of the quality of road works. Independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are also deployed by the Central Government for monitoring the quality of works randomly.Is There A Provision For The Display Of Project-Related Information At Project Sites?Citizen Information Board in the local language containing the following detailed information of work is provided on each work:-

Description of every layer of work.
Description of the quantity of material involved in work.
How the road will be built and description.
General information board containing information about executing agency, contractor, estimated cost of work and time for completion is also provided on every worksite.What Is The Role Of Public Representatives In Checking The Quality Of Implementation Of The Programme?In the interest of total transparency and to ensure the pro-active role of public representatives, the States have been advised to organize a time-bound inspection of road works with local public representatives in the following manner:-

The Superintending Engineer would request the Hon’ble M.P. and Zila Pramukh once in 6 months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.
The Executive Engineer would request the Hon’ble MLA and Chairperson of Intermediate Panchayat once in three months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.
The Assistant Engineer would request the Sarpanch once in two months duration to select road works in respective areas and joint inspection/visit would be organized.Whether Information About The Programme Is Available On Any Website?Yes, information about the programme and details about every work is available on programme website www.omms.nic.in and www.pmgsy.nic.in.The Online Monitoring and Management System (OMMS) is being used for effective management and monitoring under the programme. The required data is entered by the field level staff and the State units under this web-based package.How Are The Roads Maintained?Along with the tendering for the construction the routine maintenance of road works for five years after completion of work is also included. Programme guidelines envisage a transfer of road works for maintenance to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) after 5 years upon completion of the road work.What Should Be The Population Of Habitations To Be Covered Under PMGSY-I For Providing Connectivity?The programme envisages connecting all eligible unconnected habitations by way of an all-weather road as per Core Network with a population of 500 persons (as per 2001 Census) and above in plain areas and 250 persons and above (as per 2001 Census) in the Special Category States (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Uttarakhand), Tribal (Schedule-V) areas, the Desert Areas (as identified in Desert Development Programme) and in Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs/Planning Commission). In the critical 267 Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census)."
